# Introduction
This project aims to predict diabetes and perform comprehensive analysis using machine learning techniques and statistical methods. The workflow includes data exploration, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, data visualization, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and web application development.

# Workflow
# Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset (diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv) using Pandas.
Explore the dataset, check data types, summary statistics, and handle missing values.
# Hypothesis Testing and Statistical Analysis:

Perform hypothesis testing to analyze relationships within the data.
Conduct various statistical tests such as one-sample t-test, two-sample t-test, ANOVA, and Chi-square test.
Present results of hypothesis testing indicating acceptance or rejection of null hypotheses.
# Correlation Analysis:

Analyze correlations between different variables.
Generate heatmaps to visualize the correlation matrix.
# Data Visualization:

Utilize data visualization techniques such as box plots and scatter plots.
Visualize data distributions and relationships, particularly with respect to diabetes status.
# Preprocessing:

Preprocess data by encoding categorical variables and splitting into training and testing sets.
# Machine Learning Model Training:

Train various classification algorithms including Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, SGD, MLP, and Nearest Centroid.
# Model Evaluation:

Evaluate trained models using accuracy scores.
Generate confusion matrices to assess model performance.
# Web Application Development using Streamlit:

Develop a web application for diabetes prediction using Streamlit.
Allow users to input details (gender, age, medical history, etc.) for predicting diabetes.
Provide suggestions based on prediction results.
# Workflow Summary:

Provide a summary outlining the overall process of the project, including data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.
